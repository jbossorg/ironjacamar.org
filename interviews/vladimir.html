      <h2>Please tell us a little about yourself</h2>
      I'm Russian, living with my family (wife and son) in Prague.
      <h2>What do you do for IronJacamar ?</h2>
      I provide mostly testing support for IronJacamar. I write unit tests to check the functionality
      of IronJacamar. I also write and execute integration tests for the JCA component in WildFly.
      My primary task is to find bugs and make fixes as soon as possible, so I participate in IronJacamar
      as a developer too.
      <h2>How did you get started contributing to IronJacamar ?</h2>
      In the year 2011 I joined Red Hat's JBoss Quality Assurance Team. There I met the guys from the IronJacamar team,
      which helped me with JCA component testing. And of course the kick off meeting in Beijing had a great impact too.
      <h2>How much time do you spend working on IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Almost every day. As a JCA specialist in the QA team I need to dive into the IronJacamar code often.
      <h2>What keeps you motivated ?</h2>
      An opportunity to learn new things and participate in the world leading JCA implementation project.
      <h2>What are some of your future goals for your involvement with IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Testing of the new functional features (like DistributedWorkManager) and taking part in the development
      of the new major version of IronJacamar.
      <h2>CSKA (Moscow) vs. * ?</h2>
      CSKA forever !
      <h2>"Queen" vs. "The Beatles" ?</h2>
      Both are brilliant
      <h2>Vodka vs. Whiskey ?</h2>
      Vodka
      <h2>Lazy holiday on the beach vs. Sightseeing ?</h2>
      I'm lazy :)
      <h2>USSR vs. Russia ?</h2>
      Both. But people in USSR were better.
      <h2>What are some of your hobbies and interests outside of IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Sports (now mostly as a fan), good movies books and music, spending time with my family, cooking,
      parties with friends, travelling abroad and hiking.
      <h2>What would you suggest to help people getting started with IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Don't be afraid, just start with it. We'll help.
      <h2>Any closing comments ?</h2>
      It's a great honor for me to work with all these guys from IronJacamar. I admire
      the work we do together.
