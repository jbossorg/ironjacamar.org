      <h2>Please tell us a little about yourself</h2>
      Open source addict, amateur photographer and 4x4 enthusiast.
      <h2>What do you do for IronJacamar ?</h2>
      I work as an IronJacamar support engineer, that includes troubleshooting, bug fixing and backporting patches from upstream.
      <h2>How did you get started contributing to IronJacamar ?</h2>
      It dates back to the old JCA project, JBoss AS 5 / JBoss AS 4.3 days. The initial IronJacamar team meeting in Beijing helped me to place myself in the right direction.
      <h2>How much time do you spend working on IronJacamar ?</h2>
      This varies based on the time I have to work on our sister project HornetQ. That said, I'm hoping to contribute a bit more on IronJacamar in the days to come.
      <h2>What keeps you motivated ?</h2>
      Music, off-roading on different 4x4 drive terrains, a good beer over the weekend.
      <h2>What are some of your future goals for your involvement with IronJacamar ?</h2>
      I would like to expand my knowledge on IronJacamar's codebase to have a better understanding on its internals. That would help me to contribute to the upstream project more effectively.
      <h2>Traction control vs diff locks ?</h2>
      Love to have them both.
      <h2>Front wheel drive vs. rear wheel drive ?</h2>
      Rear wheel drive.
      <h2>Music vs. movies ?</h2>
      Music.
      <h2>CDs vs. LPs?</h2>
      LPs.
      <h2>Jazz vs. post rock ?</h2>
      Next question please.
      <h2>What are some of your hobbies and interests outside of IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Musical concerts, traveling, off-roading, camping and photography.
      <h2>What would you suggest to help people getting started with IronJacamar ?</h2>
      Read the docs and reach us for any help.
      <h2>Any closing comments ?</h2>
      It's been a great privilege to work with bunch of real talented team. Looking forward for the new challenges in the next JCA specification.
