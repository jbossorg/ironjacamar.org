      I'll be at
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">
        JavaOne
      </a>
      where I'll co-present a session about Java EE Connector Architecture with the other members of the
      expert group.
      <p></p>
      We will go over the latest changes in Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7, included in Java EE 7,
      but more importantly open the floor for a discussion about where the specification should be
      heading in future Java Enterprise Edition updates.
      <p></p>
      Java EE Connector Architecture is developed under the
      <a href="http://www.jcp.org/">
        Java Community Process
      </a>
      , so your voice matters, either as feedback or as an active member of the group.
      <p></p>
      So you should definitely attend this session if you are interested how the future of integrating
      Enterprise Information Systems into the Java EE platform should look, or if you are interested in
      learning more about Java EE Connector Architecture in general.
      <p></p>

            Whatâ€™s Next for the Java EE Connector Architecture [BOF7904]
          </i>
        </b>
        <p></p>
        The Connector architecture is a key standard on the Java EE platform for enterprise application
        integration. It provides the ability for an application to work with disparate enterprise
        information systems (EISs) such as messaging middleware and transaction monitors.
        <p></p>
        This session details the new features added to the Connectors specification in the Java EE 7
        specification and discusses potential enhancements to the standard in a future version.
        <p></p>
        Come and share your views on how the standard must evolve. This discussion is led by the specification
        lead and the expert group members of the Connector specification.
