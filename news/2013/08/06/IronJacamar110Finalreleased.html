      <h1>IronJacamar 1.1.0.Final released</h1>
      <strong>
        <i>August 6th, 2013</i>
      </strong>
      <p></p>
      I'm very proud to announce IronJacamar 1.1.0.Final, the first stable release of our IronJacamar 1.1 series.
      <p></p>
      Only minor issues were found during our CR2 testing, so the release are small.
      Full release notes are

      <h2>IronJamamar 1.1</h2>
      IronJacamar is an implementation of the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7 specification featured in the Java EE 7 Full Profile.
      <p></p>
      Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) defines a standard architecture for connecting the Java EE platform to heterogeneous Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), database and messaging systems.
      <p></p>
      IronJacamar 1.1 is the second major feature release, which brings a lot of new functionality to the Java EE Connector
      Architecture community.
      <p></p>
      The major new features includes
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7 certified</li>
        <li>Lazy connection manager</li>
        <li>Distributed work manager</li>
        <li>Advanced pool capacity policies and flush strategies</li>
        <li>Enhanced Arquillian integration</li>
        <li>Eclipse development plugin</li>
        <li>Enterprise Information System testing server</li>
        <li>Resource adapter information tool</li>
        <li>Migration tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      Lets do a run through.
      <h2>Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7</h2>
      The Java Connector Architecture 1.7 specification adds the following areas:
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adds an activation name for message endpoints to uniquely identify them</li>
        <li>Adds message endpoint class access</li>
        <li>Deployment annotations for connection factories and administration objects</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      So, this would be considered a small update to the Java EE Connector Architecture specification
      in order to align with some of the new functionality in Java EE 7, especially for JMS 2.0.
      <h2>Lazy connection manager</h2>
      A lazy connection manager allows the JCA container to move a physical connection to an Enterprise Information
      System from one logical connection handle to another logical connection handle.
      <p></p>
      The logical connection handle is the connection that the Java EE application interacts with, while the physical
      connection handle is the real connection controlled by the JCA container.
      <p></p>
      This means that there can be more logical connection handles than physical ones - so basically the physical connections
      are multiplexed between the logical ones when needed, say 1000 logical connections to 100 physical connections.
      <p></p>
      You can read more about this optional Java EE Connector Architecture feature in chapter 7.16.
      <h2>Distributed work manager</h2>
      A distributed workmanager is able to execute a
      <p></p>
      <div class="code">
        javax.resource.spi.work.DistributableWork
      </div>
      <p></p>
      instance on any node in the cluster where the associated resource adapter is deployed, and configured in the
      same way.
      <p></p>
      This allows more optimal use of the JCA based resources across the entire cluster.
      <p></p>
      The "when" and "where" is defined by policies and selectors configured on the DistributedWorkManager instance, f.ex.
      a policy of "Always" and a selector of "PingTime" will always send the work instance to the node which has the lowest
      ping time - excluding the node where the work instance was submitted to of course.
      <p></p>
      Read more about the DistributedWorkManager in chapter 10.3.11 of the specification.
      <h2>Advanced pools</h2>
      Capacity policies and additional flush strategies have been added to the connection pool backing the physical connections.
      <p></p>
      A capacity policy defines how a pool grows or shrinks when either being asked for a connection, or triggered by the idle connection
      scanner.
      <p></p>
      This means that you can get your pool to grow by 2 connections if none are available, leading to not having the connection
      overhead for the next incoming request. Same goes for shrinking where you can remove all idle connections in the pool in
      order to limit resources spent.
      <h2>Tooling</h2>
      IronJacamar 1.1 saw a lot of tooling improvements.
      <p></p>
      The integration with modern testing methods using
      <a href="http://www.arquillian.org">
        Arquillian
      </a>
      and
      <a href="http://www.jboss.org/shrinkwrap">
        ShrinkWrap
      </a>
      are now much easy to use with our embedded JCA environment, leading to easier unit test for resource adapters.
      Especially since we now have an Enterprise Information System testing server which can eliminate the need
      to actually have the real Enterprise Information System installed.
      <p></p>
      This is also made available by a new IronJacamar Eclipse plugin.
      <p></p>
      Last, but not least, there is a tool for getting valuable information about a resource adapter, and tools
      for migrating old configuration files.
      <p></p>
